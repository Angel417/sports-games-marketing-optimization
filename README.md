This analysis explored all possible firm-initiated advertising actions by EA to identify which specific actions increase the amount of buzz generated on Reddit, which would give insights to the ABA marketing team.

Furthermore, the analysis was done to find out which actions increased the price and volume of EA traded stock, which would give the marketing team insights on how to increase stock performance. Specifically, the analysis aimed to discover when these activities had the most impact (during pre-launch or post-launch periods).

This analysis focused on specific games, namely: Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and FIFA, for both 2017 and 2018. These games were chosen because out of all the games released, they were the only ones launched back-to-back, and were isolated from the other game releases.

Data cleaning included data selection ranging from 3 months prior to the launch date of Madden NFL, the first sports game launched in the year, till 3 months after the launch date of FIFA, the last game launched in the year (for both years). Skewed variables (e.g., earnings) were log-transformed, and lag-transformed during model estimations to explore delayed effects on the dependent variables (e.g., lagged effects of both owned and paid social tweets on earned Reddit comments). Null values were removed for earnings and trading volume, as the stock market is closed during weekends and holidays.
